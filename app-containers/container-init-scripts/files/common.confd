# Optionally link container memory size requirements to core scheduling...
#
# N.B. When an x86 system has SMT/Hyperthreading enabled, there is no concept
#      of a primary and a secondary core, all resources are divided between the
#      two logical processors - and therefore there is no need to schedule any
#      differently.

# e.g. Orion O6/CIX P1 (CD8180)
#cpu_cluster_little='1-4'
#cpu_cluster_medium='5-8'
#cpu_cluster_big='0,9-11'
